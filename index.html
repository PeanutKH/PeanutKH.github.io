            <p class="centered">The first atomic bomb ever produced was by the Manhattan Project.
                First started in December 1941, it was a research and development program led by the US in collaboration with Canada and the UK with the aim to develop nuclear weapons before Nazi Germany.
            </p>
            <P class="centered">
                At its peak, the Manhattan Project employed nearly 130 thousand people, costing a modern equivalent of $27 Billion USD (in 2023).
                Over 80% of the cost came from building and operating plants that produced the fissile material, and more than 30 research sites were built across the US, Canada and the UK.
